We know that one flip-flop can store one-bit of information. In order to store multiple bits of information, we require multiple flip-flops. The group of flip-flops, which are used to hold store
 the binary data is known as **register.**

If the register is capable of shifting bits either towards right hand side or towards left hand side is known as shift register. An ‘N’ bit shift register contains ‘N’ flip-flops.
The shift register, which allows serial input and produces serial output is known as Serial In – Serial Out SISO shift register.




**Schematic Diagram of SISO is shown below:**
